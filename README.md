# Pocket Dimensions
This project introduces a fascinating item to the game. It's similar to a bundle, but with a room inside. You can build whatever you want inside and take it with you!

## How to use it

After creating the item, right-click to activate and enter it. There is only one room per player. So, if you craft another one, it will take you to the same room. You can identify the room by the player name in the description. Any player with that item can join the room that the item is bound to.

When you enter your room, the pocket dimension is placed in the Overworld. Don't worry — it cannot be destroyed. However, other players can enter it as long as you are inside. You and the other players will return to the location of the pocket dimension when you leave.
